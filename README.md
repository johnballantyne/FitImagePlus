Fit Image+
============

A modified version of the Photoshop Fit Image script to allow selection of a re-sampling method

This just adds a drop down box to the existing script so that you can select which re-sampling method to use. More info [here](http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/q/18358/8708)

Currently, the resampling method is not compatible with recorded actions in Photoshop (work in progress)
